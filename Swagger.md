# 官網介紹

- SwaggerHub
    - SwaggerHub lets you create, edit and host OpenAPI definitions, collaborate on them with your team and integrate them with third-party services.
    - Anonymous users can browse and search the public API catalog. Logged in users can also view private APIs as well as create and edit API definitions.
- SwaggerHub Editor
- Swagger UI
    - Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

- Swagger Editor
    - API editor for designing APIs with the OpenAPI Specification
- Swagger UI
    - Visualize OpenAPI Specification definitions in an interactive UI

    - Swagger Editor
        - Design, describe, and document your API on the first open source editor fully dedicated to OpenAPI-based APIs. The Swagger Editor is an easy way to get started with the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger), with support for Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0.
    - Swagger Codegen
        - Swagger Codegen can simplify your build process by generating server stubs and client SDKs for any API, defined with the OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification, so your team can focus better on your API’s implementation and adoption.
